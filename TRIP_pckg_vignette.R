#### TRIP package vignette ####
# Package allowing (1) foraging trip duration from the departure to the return to the colony,
#(2) cumulative distance travelled between all locations assuming straight-line Euclidean distances between 2 successive locations,
#(3) maximum distance from the colony (hereafter “maximum range”),
#(4) average travel speed along the trip at sea (i.e. total distance travelled divided by the trip duration), and (5) maximum travel speed during the trip, computed between two successive locations, and assuming straight-line Euclidean distances.
